### commands.json

All special commands, social links, title, and description are configured in the `commands.json` file:

```json
{
  "title": "TermFolio | Interactive Terminal Portfolio",
  "description": "Welcome message and instructions",
  "specialCommands": {
    "commandName": {
      "output": "Command output text or HTML",
      "description": "Command description for help menu"
    },
    "functionCommand": {
      "output": "functionName",
      "description": "Description for function-based command",
      "isFunction": true
    }
  },
  "socials": {
    "github": "<a href=\"https://github.com/yourusername\">github.com/yourusername</a>",
    "linkedin": "<a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername\">linkedin.com/in/yourusername</a>"
  }
}
```

### Adding New Commands

To add a new special command, simply add it to the `specialCommands` object in `commands.json`.

For function-based commands that require JavaScript execution, set `isFunction` to `true` and implement the function in the `script.js` file.
